# Attendance-using-Facial-Recognition
The facial recognition attendance system operates by capturing the face of individuals as they enter a classroom. Implemented using python, alongside facial recognition libraries such as openCV or dlib, the system first captures images or video frames from a camera feed. These images are then processed to detect faces using the algorithm that compares faces to pre existing database. 
Upon successful identification, the system records attendance automatically. This process eliminates the need for manual roll calls, thereby enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Download the images to a folder named "photos" in your pc where your program file is located and run the program.
